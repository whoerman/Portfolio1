Class Assignment making portfolio

This is the intitial framework structure as part of the UNH Bootcamp for our future portfolio.

The main purpose for this was an exercise to make sure we are comfortable writing HTML and CSS.
There is very little content at this point, early in the Bootcamp.
This will be updated many times over the next few months in various versions.
